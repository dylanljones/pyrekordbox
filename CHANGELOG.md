<a name="v0.3.1"></a>
## [v0.3.1] - 2023-12-28

This release improves the Rekordbox v6 database key extraction and 
adds a new handler for smart playlists.

### New Features

- **add method to return the contents of a playlist in the RBv6 db directly**  
  The database can now be queried directly for the contents contained in a playlist. 
  This works for regular playlists as well as for smart playlists.
  The full `DjmdContent` instances of specific columns can be returned.
- **add RBv6 smart playlist handler**  
  Add a handler for the smart playlists of Rekordbox. The conditions are stored as an 
  XML string. The smart playlist handler supports parsing and writing the XML string.
- **add DB key extraction method for newer Rekordbox versions ([#97](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/discussions/97)).**  
  The key can now also be extracted with newer Rekordbox versions.
  `frida` is used to inject code to intercept the key when the DB is opened.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **populate configuration just-in-time**  
  Previously the config was populated when importing `pyrekordbox`. 
  Now the config is updated the first time it is used.
- **use association proxies in `DjmdContent` table**  
  This makes it possible to filter queries using these associations, 
  for example `DjmdContent.ArtistName`
- **add Playlist type enums and attributes**  


<a name="0.3.0"></a>
## [0.3.0] - 2023-12-12

This release fixes bugs and imrpoves error handling.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **The `bank` field of PSSI ANLZ tag can also have a value of 0 ([#108](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/108))**  
  This fixes an issue where the XOR mask was applied to un-garbled PSSI tags.
- **check if RBv6 db key seems valid ([#105](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/105))**  
  Check the key if it is passed manually to the db handler and raise an exception 
  if it doesn't look valid. Only the first few characters are checked.
- **also change `OrgFolderPath` and `FileNameL` in `update_content_path` ([#104](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/104))**  
  There were columns missing in the `update_content_path` method. 
  These changes make the file paths consistent. 
  Thank you [@ben-hearn-sb](https://github.com/ben-hearn-sb) for the help!
- **rename the `xml` module to `rbxml` to prevent conflict with builtin.**  
  Note that the old module name `xml` is deprecated and will be removed in version `0.4.0`.

### Documentation

- **add Rekordbox6 database key extraction alternatives**  


<a name="0.2.3"></a>
## [0.2.3] - 2023-11-17

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **drop Python 3.7 support**  
  Python 3.7 reached its end of lifetime in June 2023.
- **raise ImportError if RBv6 db is locked and sqlcipher is not available**  
  Pyrekordbox falls back to `sqlite3` if `sqlcipher3` is not available.
  This can lead to errors if the RBv6 database is locked and the user does not have 
  `sqlcipher3` installed.
- **don't pass deleted RBv6 instance to USN callback**  
  This sometimes raised an `ObjectDeletedError`


<a name="0.2.2"></a>
## [0.2.2] - 2023-10-26

### New Features

- **add new albums to the RBv6 db**  
  New entries can now be added to the `DjmdAlbum` table.
- **add new genres to the RBv6 db**  
  New entries can now be added to the `DjmdGenre` table.
- **add new artists to the RBv6 db**  
  New entries can now be added to the `DjmdArtist` table.
- **add new labels to the RBv6 db**  
  New entries can now be added to the `DjmdLabel` table.
- **support renamed Rekordbox application directory**  
  The user can now specify the directory name of the Rekordbox application directory. 
  This supports multiple Rekordbox installations of the same major version.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **don't raise error if key is in cache**  
  This fixes an issue when using the database handler for Rekordbox>6.6.5 with the cached key.
- **de-obfuscate PSSI tag data on exported ANLZ files**  
  The PSSI tag data of ANLZ files that rekordbox 6 *exports* is garbled with an XOR mask.
  If the first few known fields of the PSSI tag are not valid values this indicates a garbled tag
  and the data is de-obfuscated. 
  Thank you [@troyhacks](https://github.com/troyhacks) for the de-obfuscation.
- **add disabled context manager to the RBv6 `RekordboxAgentRegistry`**  
- **only re-enable RBV6 USN tracking if it was enabled**

### Documentation

- **add missing documentation of the PSSI tag of ANLZ files**  
- **Fix typo in djmdCue table documentation**  
- **update quickstart documentation**  


<a name="0.2.1"></a>
## [0.2.1] - 2023-10-20

This release migrates to SqlAlchemy 2.0 and fixes some bugs.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **migrate to SqlAlchemy 2.0**  
- **add getters/setters for the mixer gain/peak settings in the RBv6 db ([#88](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/88)).**  
  The gain and peak values are stored as high/low binary values. 
  It is now possible to get or set the gain/peak as a simple decibel value. 
  Thank you [@gsuberland](https://github.com/gsuberland) for the help!
- **automatically set `updated_at` of tables in the RBv6 db**  
  The `updated_at` column is automatically updated via `onupdate` if rows are modified. 
  This only happens if the user did not set the column manually.
- **flush the RBv6 db changes before applying USN auto-increment.**  
  This allows the user to use `before_flush` events more easily without 
  affecting the USN changes

### BREAKING CHANGE

`pyrekordbox` now only supports `sqlcipher3`. `pysqlcipher3` is no longer supported
since it is not compatible with SqlAlchemy 2.0.


<a name="0.2.0"></a>
## [0.2.0] - 2023-10-03

This release adds methods for updating playlists/playlist folders and their contents.

### New Features

- **create or delete playlists/playlist folders in the RBv6 db**  
  It is now possible to create playlists or playlist folders with arbitrary seq number 
  using the Rekordbox v6 database handler. Any playlist or playlist folder can also be 
  deleted. All corresponding songs or sub-playlists will also be deleted.
- **add or remove tracks in RBv6 playlists**  
  It is now possible to add songs with arbitrary track number to playlists in the 
  Rekordbox v6 database handler. Any song can also be removed from playlists. 
  The track numbers of the other songs in the playlist get updated accordingly.
  To make sure all changes are compatible with Rekordbox, a new handler for 
  the `masterPlaylists6.xml` auxiliary file was added.
- **move songs in playlists and playlists/playlists folders in the RBv6 db**  
  The track number of songs in playlists can now be updated. The track numbers of the 
  other songs are updated accordingly. Playlists or playlist folders can also be 
  rearranged or moved to a new parent folder.
- **add method for renaming playlists/playlist folders in the RBv6 db**  
  The update time and USN are updated accordingly.
- **add method for creating a decrypted copy of the RBv6 database ([#86](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/86))**  

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **generalize getters of list content tables in the RBv6 db**  
  This makes all getters consistent.
- **fix USN tracking and update times in playlist updates of the RBv6 db**
- **prevent commits to the RBv6 db if Rekordbox is running**
- **improve `Parent` relationship in nested tables.**  
  The `Parent` relationship in nested tables (like playlists) are now declared via `backref`. 
  This fixes a bug when deleting rows.
- **set `updated_at` in the playlist XML when committing the RBv6 db**  


<a name="0.1.8"></a>
## [0.1.8] - 2023-09-15

### New Features

- **add methods for converting RBv6 tables to a dictionary**  
  This can be used to save the database contents to an open file format, for example JSON.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **add getters for the `db_directory` and `share_directory` to the RBv6 database handler**  
  This makes it easier to access the additional data of Rekordbox (ANLZ or artwork files).
- **improve `columns` method of RBv6 tables**  
  The `columns` method now returns the *actual* columns of the table (without relationships). 
  To get a list of the column names with the relationships, use the `keys` method.
- **fix wrong ANLZ root directory in the RBv6 database handler**  
  The user can now also specify the ANLZ root directory if a database object is opened 
  in an unusual location by supplying the `db_dir` argument.
- **cache XML track list to speed up checking for duplicates**  
  The TrackID and Location of each track element is cached to prevent checking each XML 
  element when adding new tracks. In addition, the track count is now 
  incremented/decremented when adding/removing tracks. This makes it much faster to 
  add or remove elements in the XML track collection.
- **fix bug when adding tempo and position marks to XML track elements**  
  Adding new tempo of position marks was not possible due to the wrong object being 
  passed as `parent` element.
- **warn when opening the database and Rekordbox is running**  

### Documentation

- **bump furo version to fix RDT issue**  
- **remove sphinx_toggleprompt (incompatible with sphinx>=7)**  
- **Use RTD's new build process and config**


<a name="0.1.6"></a>
## [0.1.7] - 2023-08-16

This release attempts to add a workaround for the broken key extraction 
and fixes some bugs.

### New Features

- **add CLI command to download and cache the RB6 db key from the web ([#64](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/64))**  
  Pyrekordbox tries to download the key from projects that have hard-coded the key 
  (see issue [#77](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/77)). If the download was successful it writes it to the cache file.

### Improvements/Bug Fixes

- **add method for writing the RB6 db key cache manually ([#64](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/64))**  
  If the extraction of the Rekordbox database key fails (>=6.6.5), the user can now write 
  the key manually to the cache file. After updating the cache the database can be opened 
  without providing the key as argument. To make this work pyrekordbox now caches the 
  decrypted key, not the password for decrypting the key. If an old cache file is found 
  it is upgraded automatically.
- **move `install_sqlcipher.py` script to CLI command**  
  The script is now available as `pyrekordbox install-sqlcipher`.
- **add missing relationships in the RB6 database table declarations**  
  Affected tables and corresponding relationships:
  - `DjmdAlbum`: `AlbumArtist`
  - `DjmdCategory`: `MenuItem`
  - `DjmdCue`: `Content`
  - `DjmdSort`: `MenuItem`
- **fix copy/paste error in date getter of the `RekordboxAgentRegistry`**  
  The `get_date` method was actually setting the value.

### Documentation

- **add section for downloading or manually writing the RB6 db key cache**  
- **add basic docstrings to the `RekordboxAgentRegistry` object**  
- **add basic docstrings to the Rekordbox database tables**  


<a name="0.1.6"></a>
## [0.1.6] - 2023-08-13

- **cache pw extracted from the rekordbox `app.asar` file**  
  This speeds up the initialization of the package

### Documentation

- **fix modified path in update filename example ([#81](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/81))**  
- **add workaround for key extraction of the RBv6 database ([#64](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox/issues/64))**
